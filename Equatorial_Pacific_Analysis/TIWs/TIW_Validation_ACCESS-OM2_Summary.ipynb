    "This script summarizes the representation of TIWs in ACCESS-OM2-01 and ACCESS-OM2-025 when compared to OISST and CMEMS (AVISO) observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Executive summary: TIWs are too weak in both ACCESS-OM2-01/ACCESS-OM2-025 (by at least 50% in terms of filtered SSH anomalies). This may be linked to a much too weak North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) - a common feature of OMIP models that has been linked in the literature to problems with assimilation of QuikSCAT data into reanalysis products (CORE, JRA55), including a double counting of the current/relative wind effect."

    "- The magnitude of the TIV SSH anomalies are much weaker than in the observations (factor of 2 at least).\n",

    "Sun (2021) do a more detailed analysis by comparing simulations forced with JRA55-raw (no quikSCAT correction to surface winds for ocean forcing) and JRA55-do, as well as with and without current feedbacks. They find that the quikSCAT bias correction (JRA55-raw vs. JRA55-do) slows the NECC by ~60%, with possibly 26-30% of this coming from whether or not the ocean current feedback is double counted or not (where the remainig 30% is coming is not known - there are a few refs. in the conclusion). Unfortunately the JRA55-do corrections are really needed for forcing elsewhere (e.g. SO). They discuss a few possible approaches of addressing this, refering to Renault et al. (2019,2020, \"Recipes to force an ocean model...\"). There is also this ASCAT product which might do a better job than QuikSCAT?\n",

    "It looks like, like JRA-55, ERA-5 does account for neutral vs. 10m winds. However, apart from that there is no further information about this issue in the ERA-5 paper (Hersbach et al. 2020), and I don't think there is a \"do\" version of the ERA-5 forcing. **This actually means that if we force ACCESS-OM2 with raw ERA-5 data then we might do a better job with the NECC - will be interesting to see**.\n",
